### About Me :
Web developer, full stack

I am finishing my 4th year at the Irkutsk National Research Technical University with a degree in Information Systems and Technologies.

I like web development and I want to become successful in this field. I also have leadership skills and hope to use them in my career.

I have a pet project "Experience Exchange" - I am creating a website to accompany the process of increasing the level of competencies in team development through networking.

I really love hackathons for their atmosphere and the opportunity to develop hard and soft skills.

In my free time, I draw, embroider and do art.
